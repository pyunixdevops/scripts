Collection of objects which has similar properties and functionalities
Grouping together similar objects to One

For eg:
- Stationaries: Pen, Pencil, Paper, Crayons -- drawing, writing
- Groceries: 
- People: 
- Students:
- Vehicles:
- Employees: salary, increment, deveoper, admin

What are most important pieces of programming lang?
- Data structures
- Control structures and Condional loops
- **Functions(built-in functions and user defined functions) - Specific to an Object
- Exception handling
- Packages and Modules(similar to #include, source and import)
- Classes(superset of Functions) - Generic function that can be applied to many similar Objects
  -- Built-in classes - str, list, tuple and dict
  -- User defined classes - Grouping functions and attributes

OOP - Object Oriented Programming
Class(Object)

- Class can be a single object or collection of objects.
- Organized around objects and its data rather than actions & logic
- Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made
- It is a mixture of the class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3
- 

- Constructors
- Methods(functions)
- Instance creation
- Method overloading
- Method overriding
- 

A constructor is a special type of method which initializes the instance members of the class.
Constructor can be parameterized and non-parameterized as well.
Constructor definition executes when we create object of the class. 
Constructors also verify that there are enough resources for the object to perform any start-up task.




OOP concepts:
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance: Parent to Child
- Polymorphism
  -- Method overriding
  -- Method overloading
