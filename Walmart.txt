Load balancers - Physical and Software load balancers

In computing, load balancingimproves the distribution of workloads across multiple computing resources, such as computers, a computer cluster, network links, central processing units, or disk drives

DNS - Domain Name System - Hostname resolution - IP address to Hostname mapping
nameserver $IP_ADDR

/etc/resolv.conf

/etc/hosts

All hosts are having unique IP addr


Reverse proxy servers:
 - Increased security
 - Increased scalability and flexibility
 - web acceleration




A reverse proxy accepts a request from a client, forwards it to a server that can fulfill it, and returns the serverâ€™s response to the client (which means a server behind the Reverse Proxy can communicate with somewhat different features of a protocol or a different protocol).

A load balancer distributes incoming client requests among a group of servers, in each case returning the response from the selected server to the appropriate client.


A load balancer can balance traffic from layer 3 upwards to layer 7, but a reverse proxy is HTTP specific.
