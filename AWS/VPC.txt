Default VPC - 172.16.0.0/16

Multiple subnets - public subnets

What is the number

IP ranges within each subnets

DB - private subnet
Smaller DB cluster -

CIDR - - CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) or Subnetting

Network bits | Host bits
8-8-x-x - /16
8-8-8-x - /24
8-8-4-x - /20 network

/20 network - 4 subnets - 2power4 - 16 . so, the total IP addr will be 16*254
