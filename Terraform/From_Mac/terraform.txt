Terraform is a key player in the DevOps world for defining, launching, and managing
Infrastructure As Code (IAC) across a variety of cloud and virtualization platforms,
including AWS, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean and Azure.

Some of the popular tools for IAC includes Chef, Ansible, Saltstack, CloudFormation
and Terraform. Most of them are Opensource and being developed/supported by active
communities across the world. However, CloudFormation, which works only with AWS.

Chef, Puppet, Ansible, and SaltStack are all SCM tools, which means they are designed
to install and manage software on existing servers. CloudFormation and Terraform are
“Orchestration tools”, which means they are designed to provision the servers themselves,
leaving the job of installing softwares by other tools like Chef, Ansible and SaltStack.

Configuration management tools such as Chef, Puppet, Ansible, and SaltStack typically
default to a mutable infrastructure paradigm. For example, if you tell Chef to install
a new version of OpenSSL, it’ll run the software update on your existing servers and
the changes will happen in-place.
