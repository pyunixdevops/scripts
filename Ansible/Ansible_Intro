# Ansible intro
- Software Configuration Management tool - Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Saltstack
  - Install pkgs, copy files, start/stop/restart services, configuration changes
  - Patch upgrade, system maintenance, task automation
  - Bulk configuration changes on muliptle servers, by just running one playbook
  - Playbook - similar to writing Shell scripts
  - Roles - functions within Shell scripts
  - Agentless - no need of running agents on the clients, except Python

# Ansible minimal requirements - to start with - for the user
  - Ssh keys creation and copying to remote servers - Passwordless auth
  - Linux basics, shell commands and basic admin skills - Run Adhoc commands
  - Python list, dict and modules - YAML files - Ansible playbook
  - Creating groups and assign users to groups - Inventory files

# Ansible Server requirements:
 - Python 2.7 or greater
 - Ansible installation
 - Network connection
  - Inventory files - mapping of hosts into groups

# Ansible client requirements:
 - Python 2.7 or greater
 - Ssh keys copied to authorized_keys file in ~/.ssh/
 - Sshd service 
 - Network connection

# Ansible installation
- Create a Digital Ocean VM - CentOS - 4gigs ram - Ansible Sever
  - Install ansible - "yum install ansible"
  - Create ssh keys - "ssh-keygen -t rsa"
  - Copy the public key(Add NEW SSH key) to Digital Ocean's Settings->Security

-Create two Digital Ocean VM - Fedora/Ubuntu(minimal) - Ansible clients
  - Select "SSH key" of "Ansible Server", while creating the VM
  - Also, copy/select "SSH Key" of your Windows machine(created from gitbash shell)
  - Make sure Python2.7 > is installed - raw module to install from Ansible server 

# Verify setup
- Ansible Server
  - Ssh to ansible client to check passwordless auth works
  - Run Adhoc commands to clients : ansible -m shell -a "mkdir -p /export/test1"
  - Write a playbook and run it from server : ansible-playbook play1.yml
 
- Ansible client 
  - 

# Add hostname to IP address mapping in /etc/hosts file.
 - This is to make sure client's hostname is resolvable from Ansible server
