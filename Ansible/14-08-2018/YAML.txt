YAML - YAML Ain't Markup Language

Somewhat similar to JSON - Java Script Object Notation.
YAML is a superset of JSON. YAML parsers can understand JSON.
YAML is more robust and viable data serialization format.
YAML uses whitespace indentation, which is familiar in Python.
This is the way to write configuration files.
Lists and Dicts inside a configuration file.

YAML: Whitespace indentation is necessary for YAML files to be
interpreted properly. It requires more characters than JSON.

JSON: JSON doesn't use whitespace to represent hierarchy or grouping of data.
It can easily flattened without whitespace for more compact transport.

JavaScript so clearly dominates the web by a huge margin and JavaScript
developers prefer using JSON as the data format overwhelmingly along with
popular web APIs so it becomes difficult to argue using YAML over JSON
when doing web programming.
