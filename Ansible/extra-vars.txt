For some reason none of the above Answers worked for me. As I need to pass several extra vars to my playbook in Ansbile 2.2.0, this is how I got it working (note the -e option before each var):

ansible-playbook site.yaml -i hostinv -e firstvar=false -e second_var=value2



--extra-vars "version=1.23.45 other_variable=foo"

In your yml file you assign these to scoped ansible variables by doing something like:

vars:
    my_version: "{{ version }}"
    my_other_variable: {{ other_variable }}

An alternative to using command line args is to utilise environmental variables that are already defined within your session, you can reference these within your ansible yml files like this:

vars:
    my_version: "{{ lookup('env', 'version') }}"
    my_other_variable: {{ lookup('env', 'other_variable') }}
