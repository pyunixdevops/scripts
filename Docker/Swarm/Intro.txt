Swarm mode key concepts
This topic introduces some of the concepts unique to the cluster management and orchestration features of Docker Engine 1.12.
What is a swarm?

The cluster management and orchestration features embedded in the Docker Engine are built using swarmkit. Swarmkit is a separate project which implements Dockerâ€™s orchestration layer and is used directly within Docker.

A swarm consists of multiple Docker hosts which run in swarm mode and act as managers (to manage membership and delegation) and workers (which run swarm services).
